this bitch took fucking ages to get right on github so if it doesn't work on both then im gonna start playing IRL DOOM
and fucking go on a rampageing slaugher fun times :)

btw i got the code working at 4am and github is a pile of shit that makes you have to create files in a fucking mess then only allows
100 files at a time....
"/include/SFML/" folder is 98 FUCKING files without counting the .hpp files in SFML so its like 107 files that i uploaded 6 different ways
before i figured out how to upload it the right way on github.... pile of fucking shit website that could add a right click menu sorta
thing and its sorted.
